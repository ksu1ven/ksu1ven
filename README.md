 📝 My next goal is to deepen my experience in server technologies (Node.js), as well as other tools necessary for the success of the project. I have experience working in a team, I’m not afraid to be a team lead and take responsibility for decisions. Workaholic, able to combine work and additional training 6 days a week. A perfectionist, a math buff in school, and a programmer with big ambitions.

 📝 At the moment I am working on website landing (welding work), as well as launching a new site in the Republic of Belarus, where it will be possible for past tenants to leave reviews of landlords and the condition of rented apartments, as well as searching for reviews of an apartment before renting at the address.
