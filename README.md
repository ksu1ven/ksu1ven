I have experience writing online stores, various websites and applications. I want to deepen my experience in server technologies (Node.js), as well as other tools necessary for the success of the project. I have experience working in a team, I’m not afraid to be a team lead and take responsibility for decisions. Workaholic, able to combine work and additional training 6 days a week. A perfectionist, a math buff in school, and a programmer with big ambitions.
